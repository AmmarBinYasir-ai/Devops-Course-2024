  <b>Welcome to my DevOps learning journey!</b><br>
  This repository showcases my growth, hands-on projects, and the tools I've mastered as I dive into the DevOps field.<br>
  Below is a quick overview of my progress and contributions:
</p>

<h2 align="center">üìò My DevOps Learning Highlights</h2>

### <p align="center">Getting Started with Git</p>
I began by learning the essentials of Git, like `push` and `pull`, which introduced me to collaborative workflows and version control. 
This foundation allowed me to start sharing my work, including blog posts and project contributions.

<br>

### <p align="center">Exploring Docker</p>
I tackled **Docker**, a revolutionary tool in containerization. Under guidance, I successfully deployed a voting app in a Docker container, 
giving me a glimpse into the power and flexibility Docker brings to application deployment in practical environments.

<br>

### <p align="center">Cluster Deployment with Knative</p>
With **Knative**, I learned to create and manage clusters, deploying apps across multiple clusters with unique setups. 
This experience taught me the basics of cluster management in a cloud-native environment.

<br>

### <p align="center">Scaling with Kubernetes</p>
Learning **Kubernetes** was a turning point, as it offers greater advantages than Docker alone. 
I converted a Docker app to Kubernetes, gaining firsthand experience in setting up scalable, failure-resistant applications.

<br>

### <p align="center">Building EKS Clusters on AWS with Terraform</p>
I created Amazon EKS clusters using **Terraform**, applying infrastructure-as-code principles to manage resources in a consistent, repeatable way. 
Through this project, I encountered terms like "on-demand instances," "spot instances," and "capacity reservations" in AWS. 
These concepts now guide my approach to resource allocation and cost management when using AWS services.

<br>

### <p align="center">Cluster Management with Minikube and Knative</p>
Using **Minikube** and **Knative**, I explored two different approaches for managing clusters,
gaining flexibility in creating Kubernetes environments based on specific project demands.

<br>

### <p align="center">Enforcing Policies with Kyverno</p>
With **Kyverno**, I implemented policies for security and compliance within Kubernetes,
adding image restrictions and compliance audits to maintain a secure environment.

<br>

### <p align="center">Service Management with Istio</p>
Finally, **Istio** introduced me to managing microservices at scale. I set it up to monitor and manage multiple services within my app, 
enhancing performance and observability across the board.

<br>

<p align="center">Enforcing Policies with Kyverno</p>
With Kyverno, I implemented policies for security and compliance within Kubernetes,
adding image restrictions and compliance audits to maintain a secure environment.

<p align="center">Python Calculator Project with GitHub Actions</p>
In this project, I created a basic Python calculator application and used GitHub Actions to automate testing and ensure code quality.
The workflow runs tests automatically on every push to main, demonstrating the effectiveness of CI/CD pipelines.
