Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This repository showcases my growth, hands-on projects, 
and the tools I've mastered as I dive into the DevOps field. Below is a quick overview of my progress and contributions:

üìò My DevOps Learning Highlights
1. Getting Started with Git
I began by learning the essentials of Git, like push and pull,which introduced me to collaborative workflows and version control.
This foundation allowed me to start sharing my work, including blog posts and project contributions.

3. Exploring Docker
I tackled Docker, a revolutionary tool in containerization. Under guidance, I successfully deployed a voting app in a Docker container,
giving me a glimpse into the power and flexibility Docker brings to application deployment in practical environments.

5. Cluster Deployment with Knative
With Knative, I learned to create and manage clusters, deploying apps across multiple clusters with unique setups.
This experience taught me the basics of cluster management in a cloud-native environment.

7. Scaling with Kubernetes
Learning Kubernetes was a turning point, as it offers greater advantages than Docker alone.
I converted a Docker app to Kubernetes, gaining firsthand experience in setting up scalable, failure-resistant applications.

9. Building EKS Clusters on AWS with Terraform
I created Amazon EKS clusters using Terraform, applying infrastructure-as-code principles to manage resources in a consistent, repeatable way.
Through this project,I encountered terms like "on-demand instances," "spot instances," and "capacity reservations" in AWS.
These concepts now guide my approach to resource allocation and cost management when using AWS services.

11. Cluster Management with Minikube and Knative
Using Minikube and Knative, I explored two different approaches for managing clusters,
gaining flexibility in creating Kubernetes environments based on specific project demands.

13. Enforcing Policies with Kyverno
With Kyverno, I implemented policies for security and compliance within Kubernetes,
adding image restrictions and compliance audits to maintain a secure environment.

15. Service Management with Istio
Finally, Istio introduced me to managing microservices at scale. I set it up to monitor and
manage multiple services within my app, enhancing performance and observability across the board.

üöÄ Skills and Tools
Version Control: Git
Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube
Cluster Management: Knative, Amazon EKS (via Terraform)
Policy Management: Kyverno
Service Mesh: Istio

üõ£Ô∏è My DevOps Journey
This journey has been incredible, equipping me with the skills to manage containers, automate infrastructure, enforce security policies, and optimize microservices. 
I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge in this field and learning even more as I continue!
